# Overview
![Stock Advisor Design](doc/stock-advisor-services.png)

This repo is part of the Stock Advisor project found here:

https://github.com/hanegraaff/stock-advisor-infrastructure

This project contains the Stock Advisor application software. It is organized into two services that run as docker images. The first is a recommendation system that generates predictions based on various trading strategies, and the second is a portfolio manager that executes trades based on those same predictions.

# Financial Brokerage and Data
This software relies on a range of financial data to perform its calculations. As of this version, data is sourced from Intrinio, though other providers may be supported in the future.

Intrinio offers free access to their sandbox, which gives developers access to a limited dataset comprising of the DOW30, and the results presented here are based on that list. A paid subscription allows access to a much larger universe of stocks.

This software also has the ability to trade automatically and requires access to a personal TD Ameritrade brokerage account. Once configured, it will use the cash available in the account to maintain an evolving portfolio based on the latest recommendations.

# Prerequisites
1) Python 3.8
2) Intrinio API Key
3) Access to a TDAmeritrade brokerage account
4) Access to AWS account.

## Authentication Keys
All authentication keys are stored as environment variables. When running locally these
must be exported to the environment, and when running on ECS they are sourced directly
from the parameter store and fed to the container environment. This section describes the process of exporting keys locally.

### Intrinio API Key
You will need to set up an Intrinio API Key (https://www.intrinio.com) with access to the "US Fundamentals and Stock Prices" and "Zacks Price Targets" feeds.

the API must be saved to the environment like so:

```export INTRINIO_API_KEY=[your API key]```

### TDAmeritrade Keys
Additionally, you will need to authenticate with TDAmeritrade in order to buy and sell securities. This software will treat the account as its own, meaning that any
positions that are not part of its portfolio, will be unwound. Specifically, it will
execute trades in a way that positions will always match those in the recommended portfolio.

TDAmeritrade uses OAuth for authentication, and the initial setup process is described
here:

https://github.com/hanegraaff/TDAmeritrade-api-authentication

As of this version you must manually create an authorization code and an inital refresh token that will be valid for 3 months, after which the process must be repeated.

Once you generate these artifacts, you must save them in the environment like this:

```
export TDAMERITRADE_ACCOUNT_ID=[your TDAmeritrade Account ID]
export TDAMERITRADE_CLIENT_ID=[your TDAmeritrade Client ID/Consumer Key]
export TDAMERITRADE_REFRESH_TOKEN=[your TDAmeritrade refresh token]
```

## Develpment Environment
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

It is highly recommended to run this in a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Be sure that ```python3``` points to Python 3.8. Alternatively you can create the virtual environment this way:

```
python3.8 -m venv venv
...
```

All scripts must be executed from the ```src``` folder.

# Trading Strategies
All recommendations produced by this system are created using Trading Strategies which are located in the ```strategies``` module of this software. A strategy is simply and algorithm that reads a list of securities (currently US Equities), downloads all necessary financial data and either ranks or filters the list to produce a subset of that will outperform their peers based on the algorithm's calculations. 

All strategies are implemented as classes that derive from the ```BaseStrategy``` Abstract Base Class, and expose a consistent interface. Each is self contained in the sense that they must be able to initialize for a configuration file which can either be stored locally or in S3; this is how strategies are initialized in production. They can also be initialized using constructor, a technique which is useful when backtesting or performing other types of tests.

## Inputs
The main input to a Trading Strategy is a list of ticker symbols used a a basis for the analysis. All available strategies are based on US Equities, but other markets may be supported in the future. 

Each list is represented as a ```TickerList``` object and persisted using a JSON Document, and like other inputs, they may be sourced locally or from S3.

Here is an example of a list representing the DOW30.

```JSON
{
	"list_name": "DOW30",
	"list_type": "US_EQUITIES",
	"comparison_symbol": "DIA",
	"ticker_symbols":[
		"AAPL",
		"AXP",
		"BA",
		"CAT",
		"CSCO",
		"CVX",
		"GE",
		"GS",
		"HD",
		"IBM",
		"INTC",
		"JNJ",
		"JPM",
		"KO",
		"MCD",
		"MMM",
		"MRK",
		"MSFT",
		"NKE",
		"PFE",
		"PG",
		"TRV",
		"UNH",
		"V",
		"VZ",
		"WMT",
		"XOM"
	]
}
```

When running in production, inputs are defined in a configuration file and are supplied to a strategy during initialization. This configuration identifies the appropriate ticker list and defines other static parameters used by the strategy.

```ini
[price_dispersion_strategy]
ticker_list_file_name=djia30.json
output_size=3
```

This is an example of a strategy that is initialized using configuration. The application namespace is used to identify the S3 bucket used to store inputs. All inputs can be soured locally or from S3. In fact if an input is sourced from S3 and is not found, this software will look for a suitable local alternative and upload it to S3. This is done to simplify the preparation work when new strategies are inroduced.

```python
from support import constants
from support.configuration import Configuration

app_namespae = 'sa'

config = Configuration.try_from_s3(
    constants.STRATEGY_CONFIG_FILE_NAME, app_namespae)
pd_strategy = PriceDispersionStrategy.from_configuration(config, app_namespae)
```

Alternatively, strategies can be initialized using a plain constructor. The two methods are functionally equivalent.

```python
from model.ticker_list import TickerList

ticker_list = TickerList.from_local_file(
            "%s/djia30.json" % (constants.APP_DATA_DIR))

pd_strategy = PriceDispersionStrategy(
            ticker_list, '2020-06', date(2020, 2, 22), 3)
```

## Outputs
The output of a strategy is a RecommendationSet object which contains the list of recommended securitues and a date range indicating its valid duration. Each strategy is different, and some will produce reommendations that can change daily (e.g. MACD crossover strategy) while others will last much longer (e.g. Price Dispersion Strategy)

Once a strategy is initialized, it can be executed like this. the ```display_results``` display all inermediate data and final results to the screen, and is optional.

```python
pd_strategy.generate_recommendation()
pd_strategy.display_results()

# this is the final recommendation
recommendation_set = pd_strategy.recommendation_set
```

And here is what the recommedation will look like

```JSON
{
    "set_id": "5d6c5a42-b54d-11ea-a412-acbc329ef75f",
    "creation_date": "2020-06-23T12:30:47.271203+00:00",
    "valid_from": "2020-06-01",
    "valid_to": "2020-06-30",
    "price_date": "2020-05-31",
    "strategy_name": "PRICE_DISPERSION",
    "security_type": "US Equities",
    "securities_set": [
        {
            "ticker_symbol": "BA",
            "price": 145.85
        },
        {
            "ticker_symbol": "GE",
            "price": 6.57
        },
        {
            "ticker_symbol": "XOM",
            "price": 45.47
        }
    ]
}

```

## Price Dispersion Strategy

### Description
This strategy generates monthly US Equities recommendations using a market sentiment algorithm that ranks stocks based on the level of analyst target price agreement, and is based on the findings of paper like these:

|Paper|Author(s)|
|--|--|
|[Consensus Analyst Target Prices: Information Content and Implications for Investors](doc/Consensus-Analyst-Target-Prices.pdf)|Asa B. Palley, Thomas D. Steffen, X. Frank Zhang|
|[Dispersion in Analystsâ€™ Target Prices and Stock Returns](doc/Dispersion-Analysts-Target-Prices-Stock-Returns.pdf)|Hongrui Feng Shu Yan|
|[The predictive power of analyst price target and its dispersion](doc/Predictive-Power-Analyst-Price-Target-Dispersion.pdf)|Heng(Emily) Wang, Shu Yan|

They suggest, among other things, that when taken individually or even on average, analyst price targets are not a good predictor of returns, but the degree of agreement/disagreement is.

The strategy is designed to run once per month once all price forecasts are available. Analysts typically update their forecasts on a monthly basis. Recommendations that result from this strategy are valid from the entire calendar month and are only updated at the beginning of following month.

These are the specific steps:

1) For each ticker symbol in the securities list download:
    - Current Price
    - Analyst price forecast average
    - Analyst price forecast standard deviation
    - Analyst price forecast count (i.e. total forecasts)
2) Normalize the standard deviation by converting it into a percentage relative to the price.
3) Load data into a Pandas DataFrame, rank it by this percentage and sort into deciles. Sort each decile by expected return.
4) Select a subset from the top decile(s). This will return stocks with the largest level of disagreement.

### Inputs
Other than the standard inputs described above this strategy requires an ```output_size``` that indicates how many securities to return from the top decile.

### Outputs
The following is the output that is displayed when the ```display_results()``` is called.

## MACD Crossover Strategy
### Description
This is a momentum based strategy that will determine which securities in the ticker list are rallying. Rallying stocks are included in the recommendation and indicate a buy signal, while slumping stocks are excluded, and indicate a sell.

Momentum is measured by looking at the combination of the MACD oscillator and the 50 day simple moving average. 

Specifically this is how the algorithm works:
1) For each security in the ticker list download the following:
    - Current Price
    - Previous 3 days of Simple Moving Average
    - Previos 3 days of MACD data

2) If the Current Price dipped below the SMA in the past 3 days, exclude the security
3) If the MACD value dips below the signal abuptly, or trends below it for a period of time, exclude the security.
4) In all other cases, e.g. when the price is above the SMA and the MACD has positively crossed the signal, include the security.




# Securities Recommendation Service
![Security Recommendation Service Design](doc/recommendation-service.png)

The Securities Recommendation service is a component of the Stock Advisor system that 
## Recommendation Service Release Notes
This is an initial version that offers the following features

* Ability to rank securities and generate recommendation.
* Local caching of financial data
* Back testing capability
* Ability to run inside a Docker container
* Integrate into Stock Advisor Infrastructure, specifically ECS.


## Running the service from the command line
The easiest way to run this service is via the command line. This section describes how.

```
src >>python securities_recommendation_svc.py -h
usage: securities_recommendation_svc.py [-h] -ticker_file TICKER_FILE -output_size
                                   OUTPUT_SIZE
                                   {test,production} ...

Reads a list of US Equity ticker symbols and recommends a subset of them based
on the degree of analyst target price agreement, specifically it will select
stocks with the lowest agreement and highest predicted return. The input
parameters consist of a file with a list of of ticker symbols, and the month
and year period for the recommendations. The output is a JSON data structure
with the final selection. When running this script in "production" mode, the
analysis period is determined at runtime, and the system will interact with the AWS
infrastructure to read inputs and store outputs.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -ticker_file TICKER_FILE
                        Ticker Symbol local file path
  -output_size OUTPUT_SIZE
                        Number of selected securities

environment:
  runtime environment

  {test,production}     the runtime environment of the application. It can be
                        either "test" or "production"
    test                Test mode. Analysis period and current date must be
                        passed explicitly
    production          Production mode. Analysis period and current date are
                        determined at runtime
```

Where ```-ticker_file``` represents a local file or s3 object used to represent the universe of stocks that will be considered. It must contain
a single ticker symbol per line.

```
AAPL
AXP
BA
CAT
CSCO
CVX
...
```

and ```-output_size``` represents the total number of recommended
stocks resulting from the analysis.

The script can be run in two modes, representing different runtime environments.

### Production mode
**Production** mode will automatically determine the analysis period based on the calendar date, and display actual returns using the same. It will also use S3 to read the inputs and store results. This is the mode that must be used when running in ECS.

In this mode the service will identify the appropriate AWS infrastructure using a combination of CloudFormation exports and a namespace suppled to the command line (```-app_namespace```) used to avoid collisions. So for example, if the application namespace is set to ```sa```, the S3 bucket will be identified using the ```sa-data-bucket-name``` export. These are defined in the ```support.constants``` module.

Finally, the recommendation set will be stored in s3, and a new one will only be created when the existing one expires. If the recommendation set is still valid, the script will quietly exit

```
src >>python securities_recommendation_svc.py production -h
usage: securities_recommendation_svc.py production [-h] -app_namespace
                                            APP_NAMESPACE

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-app_namespace APP_NAMESPACE
                        Application namespace used to identify AWS resources
```

For example:
```
python securities_recommendation_svc.py -ticker_file djia30.txt -output_size 3 production -app_namespace sa
```

This example generates a 3 stock recommendation using the DOW30 as an input, and using the latest analysis period based on calendar date.

### Test mode
**Test** mode expects the analysis period to be supplied using the command line, and will not interact with AWS, but rather rely on local resources. This mode is used when running and testing outside the production environment, and may also be used to run historically.

In this mode, ```-price_date``` is optional, and is used to determine the price date used to display the current returns of the selection.
    
```
src >>python securities_recommendation_svc.py test -h
usage: securities_recommendation_svc.py test [-h] -analysis_month ANALYSIS_MONTH
                                        -analysis_year ANALYSIS_YEAR
                                        [-price_date PRICE_DATE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -analysis_month ANALYSIS_MONTH
                        Analysis period's month
  -analysis_year ANALYSIS_YEAR
                        Analysis period's year
  -price_date PRICE_DATE
                        Price Date (YYYY/MM/DD) used to compute current
                        returns

```

For example:
```
python securities_recommendation_svc.py -ticker_file djia30.txt -output_size 3 test -analysis_year 2020 -analysis_month 1 -price_date 2020/03/01 
```

This will generate a 3 stock recommendation using a local ticker file of the DOW 30 using an analysis period of 01/2020 and a price date of 03/01

```analysis_year``` / ```analysis_month``` represent the financial period of the analyst forecasts, and ```price_date``` is the price date used to calculate the portfolio's current returns.

When a new portfolio is generated and the service is running in ```production``` mode, an SNS event will be published resulting in the below email/sms notification.

```
From: sa-app-notification-topic (no-reply@sns.amazonaws.com)
To: Me

A New Stock Recommendation is available for the month of April


Ticker Symbol: BA
Ticker Symbol: GE
Ticker Symbol: XOM
```

The previous output illustrates what happens when a new recommendation is created. While running in ```test``` mode always creates a new recommendation, ```production``` mode will first check for an existing recommendation in S3 and only create a new one if one cannot be found or if it is expired based on ```valid_from``` ```valid_to``` date range. If the recommendation is still valid, the service will quietly exit and the output will look like this:

```
[INFO] - Parameters:
[INFO] - Environment: PRODUCTION
[INFO] - Ticker File: djia30.txt
[INFO] - Output Size: 3
[INFO] - Analysis Month: 4
[INFO] - Analysis Year: 2020

[INFO] - Recommendation set is still valid. There is nothing to do
```

## Caching of financial data
All financial data is saved to a local cache to reduce throttling and API limits when using the Intrinio API. As of this version the data is set to never expire, and the cache will grow to a maximum size of 4GB.

The cache is located in the following path:

```
./financial-data/
./financial-data/cache.db
```

To delete or reset the contents of the cache, simply delete entire ```./financial-data/``` folder


## Backtesting
It is possible to backtest this strategy by running the ```price_dispersion_backtest.py``` script. It works by running the strategy from 05/2019 to 1/2020 and comparing the returns of the selected portfolio with the average of the list supplied to it.

Example:

```
>>python price_dispersion_backtest.py -ticker_file djia30.txt -output_size 3
[INFO] - Parameters:
[INFO] - Ticker File: djia30.txt
[INFO] - Output Size: 3

# Portfolio Manager
![Portfolio Manager Design](doc/portfolio-manager.png)

The Portfolio Manager service is a component of the Stock Advisor system that actively manages a protfolio based on the output of the recommendation service. The service is designed to run daily, and typically takes a few seconds to execute. When running in ECS, the service is scheduled to run daily at 11am EST, and will maintain a stock portfolio on the supplied TDAmeritrade account.

## Portfolio Manager Release Notes
This is an initial version that offers the following features:

* Create new portfolio based on latest recommendation, or update an existing one stored in S3.
* Execute trades necessary to materialize the portfolio.
* Ability to run inside a Docker container
* Integrate into Stock Advisor Infrastructure, specifically ECS.
* Send SNS Notifications with summary of returns and any trading activity


## Trading Strategy
The current strategy is to buy and hold a portfolio based on the most recent recommendations. When a new recommendation set is created, the portfolio will be rebalaned accordingly. Specifically, each time service is run, it will do the following:

1) Read the latest recommendations and portfolio objects from S3.
2) Reprice the portfolio and update it based on the contents of the recommendations. If the portfolio recommendations have changed then create a new portfolio, otherwise keep the existing one.
3) Check to see of the Equities market is open and if it is, materialize the portfolio. This means taking the securities in it, which represent the desired state, and execute the trades necessary to create matching positions.
4) If there are any errors, and only a portion of the portfolio could be materialized, the same actions will be retried the next time the service runs.


## Running the Portfolio Manager from the command line
```
>>python portfolio_manager_svc.py -h
usage: portfolio_manager_svc.py [-h] -app_namespace APP_NAMESPACE
                                -portfolio_size PORTFOLIO_SIZE

Executes trades and maintains a portfolio based on the output of the
recommendation service

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -app_namespace APP_NAMESPACE
                        Application namespace used to identify AWS resources
  -portfolio_size PORTFOLIO_SIZE
                        Number of securties that will be part of the portfolio
```

where ```app_namespace``` has the same meaning as it does for the recommendation service, namely to identify AWS resources based on the CloudFormation exports exposed by the infrastructure and automations scripts. ```portfolio_size``` on on the other hand will determine the size of the portfolio by selecting a subset of the recommendation.

For example:

```
>>python portfolio_manager_svc.py -app_namespace sa -portfolio_size 3
```

## Portfolio Manager Output

The main output of the service is an updated portfolio, stored in S3. Here is an example output generated by running the service

After updating the portfolio a notification will be sent to SNS with the selected portfolio and its current returns. This results in the following email.

```
From: sa-app-notification-topic (no-reply@sns.amazonaws.com)

# Notifications
Both services will publish SNS notification in case of important events. Specifically, it will publish events in the following scenarios:

1) When the Recommendation Service Produces a new recommendation
2) Daily, showing the portfolio's current positions and returns.
3) When an error occurs that prevents either service from working.

The first two notifications are described in more details in the previous sections. Error notifications, on the other hand tend to be more generic, and are really intended to bring attention to the fact that the system is unstable. This is important because for the most part things are running autonomously and don't require any special interaction on behalf of the user.

Each notification includes an error message and a stack trace and are intended for a technical audience. Future version of this software will introduce a UI or other ways of interacting with the system that won't necessarily rely on the AWS console.

The following is an example of an error notification that is produced by the portfolio manager when the current recommendation set has expired (recommendations always come with expiration dates).

```
From: sa-app-notification-topic (no-reply@sns.amazonaws.com)
To: Me

There was an error running the Portfolio Manager Service: Validation Error: Current recommendation set is not valid

   raise ValidationError("Current recommendation set is not valid", None)
exception.exceptions.ValidationError: Validation Error: Current recommendation set is not valid
```

# Running the Services
The previous sections describe how to run the application locally. It's possible to run the recommendation sytem and back test without any dependencies to AWS.
The portfolio manager can also be run locally, but does have dependencies to AWS, though a future version of it won't require it.

This section describes how to run the services either locally using Docker, or using ECS. The latter, specifically AWS Fargate, is the intended runtime platform for these services.


## Running the service as a docker image
It is possible to package the services as a Docker image. To build the container, run the ```docker_build.sh```. This command will build both Stock Advisor services, and you'll be able to run them locally.

```
>>./docker_build.sh

 ---> f1a79df20439
Successfully built f1a79df20439
Successfully tagged stock-advisor/recommendation_svc:v1.0.0
```
The resulting image will look like this:
```
>>docker images
REPOSITORY                         TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

stock-advisor/recommendation-svc   v1.0.0              4f443c16ccce        38 seconds ago      435MB
python                             3.8-slim-buster     56930ef6f6a2        2 weeks ago         193MB
```

Once built, the container is executed in a similar way as the script. Note how the ```INTRINIO_API_KEY``` must be supplied as a special environment variable when running the recommendation system. AWS credentials must also be supplied externally, in a similar way.

For example:

```
docker run -e INTRINIO_API_KEY=xxx image-id -ticker_file djia30.txt -output_size 3 production -app_namespace sa
```

## Running the service in ECS
This service is intended to be run in ECS using a Fargate task. The automation contained in the main project will create the ECS Cluster, Task Definitions, Scheduled Tasks, Container Repositories and CodeBuild project needed to build and deploy the service to AWS. Please refer to the main project for instructons on how to leverage automation to build and deploy the system.

Both the Recommendation Service and Portfolio manager are configured to run as scheduled tasks, and run daily

Tasks may be run on demand using the AWS console and navigating to the ECS Task defintions

When running the task be sure to set the following:

1) Set the launch type to ```Fargate```.
2) Select the VPC that was created using the automation. The CIDR block is 192.16.0.0/16, or you can check the tags to identify the proper one.
3) Select a security group with 'no inbound/full outbound' access. This automation creates one called ```sa-sg```.
4) Ensure the that a public IP address is auto assigned.

All application logs are stored inside CloudWatch.

# Unit Testing
You may run all unit tests using this command:

```./test.sh```

This command will execute all unit tests and run the coverage report (using coverage.py)

```
